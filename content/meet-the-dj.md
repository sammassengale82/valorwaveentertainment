# Meet the DJ

Hello! My name is **Sam Massengale**, and I’ve proudly called Chattanooga home my entire life.  
I served over 12 years in the United States Army and hold a Master’s Degree from Belhaven University.  
I am blessed with a wonderful wife and four amazing boys.

Alongside my wife, I decided it was time to turn our passion for music and singing into something special — and that’s how Valor Wave Entertainment was born.

With over 12 years of DJ experience across weddings, corporate events, and community celebrations, I bring professionalism, creativity, and heart to every event.

Guided by our loving Father and Jesus Christ, our mission is simple: to provide a worry‑free, faith‑based, unforgettable experience.  
We look forward to honoring every moment — and all heroes — while creating memories that last a lifetime.
